""" Explanation:
Let N = the total we are trying to make
Let M = the total number of distinct coins we can use
Let the coins be indexed the variable m and v_m be the value of the mth coin

Let C[t, m] = the number of ways to make total t using all coins <= m
Then we can define the recurrence:
        v = value of the mth coin
        C[t, m] = C[t, m-1] + C[t-v, m]     if t >= v
                = C[t, m-1]                 otherwise

Intuitively, this recurrence is just 
    (# of ways to make t with <= m coins) = (# of ways to make t without coin m) + (# of ways to make t forcing at least 1 coin m to be used)

The answer will be the last element: C[N, M]
The time complexity of this is only O(NM), which is much better than O(M^N) as in the brute force method


We can make the code a bit more elegent by doing this summation in a more clever way
by removing redundant information, since we only care about C[t, M] for all t
Therefore, let C[t] = the number of ways to make total t using all coins
Essentially, in each iteration of the for-loop C[t] = C[t, m]
